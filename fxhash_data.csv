"Sketchy Note : ""Algorithmic partition""",https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/sketchy-note-:-%22algorithmic-partition%22,working,"are handled by an algorithm that generates various modes through different variations. In this project, after the boxes rotate, an uneven partitioning of the canvas occurs, which is then applied to the animation. As you can see, the partitioned elements on the canvas are connected to each other by a separate algorithm, without crossing over the boxes or other elements, creating a sketchy form. The project has been developed in these three stages and has taken about three weeks to complete. I hope you enjoy viewing it. The preview image might take up to 10 to 15 minutes to render.

The first challenge was that the system we were using to create the project couldn’t handle rendering and exporting such a large volume of Java code. Therefore, we needed to find a solution. The solution we came up with was to transfer the background to the setup and distribute the elements on the screen in such a way that they leave their traces on the background as they move. This way, we no longer need to complicate the rendering process with loops (for).The second challenge we faced was that the code only provided us with a static view of the scene. So, how could different variations be created in the project? To solve this issue, we focused on creating variations based on the distribution of colors.

Biomes,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/biomes,working,"In the far reaches of the cosmos, where the boundaries between reality and dreams blur into an indistinguishable haze, there exists a planet of breathtaking beauty and terrifying complexity. It is a sentient biome, whose very existence defies the laws of nature as we understand them.Here, the skies blaze with colors that shift and change as if they were living entities themselves, reflecting the chaotic yet harmonious energy of the planet below. Jagged and fierce mountains stand like guardians of ancient secrets, their peaks aflame with molten rivers that dance in shades of orange and gold, casting long shadows that seem to pulse with life.In the valleys, forests of crystal trees stretch towards the heavens, their branches etched with patterns that shift like serpents in the depths of a dream. Their colors span a spectrum of green and yellow, glowing softly as if each tree harbors a soul. They whisper to each other in the wind, their secrets carried across the landscape like a melody forgotten and remembered in the same breath.Creatures of light and shadow inhabit this world, their forms as fluid and ever-changing as the landscape itself. Some soar above on wings of pure energy, leaving trails of color that shimmer and dissolve into the air. Others burrow deep into the earth, their bodies glowing with the heat of the planet's core, their movements creating ripples that send shockwaves across the surface.Yet amidst this kaleidoscope of chaos, there exists a strange and beautiful order. The biomes are interconnected, each one feeding into the next in a delicate balance of life and death, growth and decay.In this world, the story of life is told not through words, but through the shifting patterns of the landscape, through the vibrant colors that flicker and pulse with the heartbeat of the planet. It is a tale of resilience, of adaptation, of life finding a way even in the most inhospitable of places.As the stars twinkle in the dark expanse above, casting their cold light on this living, breathing world, the biomes continue to whisper their ancient tales to anyone who will listen. They tell of a planet where life is not merely sustained, but celebrated in a continuous cycle of creation and destruction — a reminder that in the vastness of the universe, life is a force that will always find a way.—-Press [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .pngMade with p5.jsRob Scalera | 2024"

Pure Automatism Simulator,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/pure-automatism-simulator,working,"FULL TITLE:Pure Automatism Simulator. Human, as part of a generative algorithm, generates their own unconscious abstraction based on another abstraction generated by the algorithm.DESCRIPTIONThis project is a new step in the exploration of automatism in art, a method in which the creation of works occurs without conscious control, allowing a person's unconscious to influence the creative process. But how is it possible to disable consciousness if the Homo Creator inevitably realizes and naturally controls what they create? Art history knows numerous physically crafted techniques of automatism, from André Breton to Jackson Pollock; the Pure Automatism Simulator project offers a completely new, generative-oriented approach to examining this issue.Here's how:The consciousness of the user-creator is redirected to performing a simple task unrelated to the process of creating an artwork, and the creation of the artwork, which occurs at the same time, remains in the realm of the unconscious.It sounds confusing :) But it's actually quite simple.The algorithm generates a canvas with an animated abstract image, which includes, among other things, elements in the form of bars. A double click starts the simulation, the bars begin to extend, and the viewer's task is to move the cursor to the edges of the bars and make them retract. At this moment, the cursor's trajectory is captured, and after the simulation-animation ends and the bars stop extending, another part of the algorithm visualizes the recorded trajectory using an algorithmic brush. By pressing and holding on the canvas, you can view the unconsciously created artwork.A double click starts a new simulation cycle.This process allows for the creation of unique abstract compositions with each iteration, which will depend not only on how the bars happen to extend (which is random each time), but also on the user's attention, mood, and reaction.____________________________INSRUCTIONS for creating your unconscious painting:1. Double-click on the canvas to start the Simulator.2. Move the cursor to the edges of the extending bars, causing them to retract.3. Once the Simulator has finished (the bars stop extending), long-press to review the result - an abstraction created by you unconsciously.4. To save the result, press one of the buttons a, s, d, or f, depending on the desired resolution (a - min, f - max). The upper layer can be saved with the q, w, e, or r.5. Double-click on the canvas to restart the Simulator.Changing animation dynamics and duration: ⇧⇩ for dynamics and ⇦ ⇨ for duration.For printing the lower layer (your unconscious abstraction): Press 't' before saving to disable textures and set the full brightness range."

Lightweight Deconstruction,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/lightweight-deconstruction,working,"Lightweight Deconstruction tells a story of architectural materiality with a sci-fi twist. It asks, quite literally, “what if Gottfried Semper’s Four Elements of Architecture were in fact elemental?” Taking cues from scientific visualization, the project imagines a series of laboratory-synthesized architectural elements that correspond loosely to those identified by Semper in his 1851 book. Here, “Roof,” “Mound,” “Hearth,” and “Enclosure” are represented as microscopic photographs or CT scans of ethereal assemblies, suggesting an alternative reading of these classical tropes. If materials always tell stories, we’re interested in the new kinds of stories that virtual/digital materials can tell beyond appliqués or textures. From a technical point of view, the project explores concepts of lightness in two ways: (1) in terms of volumetric representation and (2) in terms of data size. While typical digital rendering techniques represent materials as surface images applied to geometry through a UV map, this project puts forth a volumetric approach to material visualization. Lightweight Deconstruction substitutes typical surface raytracing algorithms with a custom-built volumetric raytracing engine that renders uncanny, vaporous, lightweight volumes. The resulting software is compressed and optimized to approximately 30kb, addressing the second interest in “lightweight” assemblies: data. The small software size allows the project to be portable and accessible, concerns that are increasingly important in the era of big data.Lightweight Deconstruction is part of an ongoing project we call ""Lightweight Construction"" that questions the relationship between virtual and physical materials while finding new kinships between them. It acts as a critical response to ongoing dialogues of digital models and their perceptions in design disciplines. Today, it is common to hear the virtual world described as a mirror world, and digital buildings are referred to as “digital twins.” While these may be apt ways to familiarize oneself with these mediums, they still skirt the core contradictions at play in virtual/digital space. We believe that contradictions are not hindrances but opportunities for richer forms of engagement. These projects embrace contradictions and test their limits through distinct material explorations in virtual space. Together, the projects that make up ""Lightweight Construction"" form a conceptual triptych that forces us to think deeper about pixels, voxels, and their narrative potentials.Usage:Press ‘s’ to save a screenshot.Double-click/tap to pause and continue rendering.Press ‘p’ to pause rotation and rendering.Press ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘0’ to zoom in/out.Disclaimer:This project uses WebGL2 and is GPU intensive.

BITXO [🎧],https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/bitxo-1,working,"""Bitxo""by @poperbu_Bitxo is a work created to be presented at the Digital Art Festival ""Responsive Dreams Festival 2024""""Bitxo"" (bug in Catalan) is a generative work of art that combines visual and audio elements to provide an immersive and impactful experience. This piece is a personal creation that explores and represents the way a mental illness, in this particular case an addiction, can affect all aspects of a life.Visual Aspects: The visual part of ""Bitxo"" is composed of dynamic patterns and changing colors that evolve unpredictably, reflecting the chaotic and uncontrolled nature of an addiction. The shapes and colors seem to be in constant motion, creating a sense of unease and confusion. The use of light and shadow helps create stark contrasts that symbolize the emotional ups and downs associated with this condition. All visuals are generated in real-time using p5.js technology, so no experience is the same, underscoring the unpredictability of living with an addiction.Sound Aspects: The sound component of ""Bitxo"" is based on generative sounds that evolve together with the visuals. The sounds can range from soft, harmonious tones to shrill, dissonant noises, creating a soundtrack that reflects the inner turmoil and emotional conflict of a person struggling with addiction. There is no pre-rendered or pre-recorded sound; the entire soundscape is generated in real time using Pure Data and WebPd technologies. Sound patterns are synchronized with the visuals, increasing immersion and providing an auditory representation of the visual experience.Interactivity and modalities: The work ""Bitxo"" has two modes of reproduction. In the fully automatic and autonomous mode, the work is generated and evolves without external intervention, highlighting the unpredictability and self-sufficiency of the creative process. In the interactive mode, the viewer can control different aspects of the work (life) and the 'bitxo' by means of a MIDI device (Korg NanoKontrol and NanoKontrol2), as well as by keyboard. This interactivity allows the viewer to influence the visual and sound evolution, representing the attempt to control and manage an addiction.Personal message: ""Bitxo"" is a deeply personal work that wants to communicate how a mental illness, in this case an addiction, can infiltrate and affect all aspects of a life. The piece shows how this condition can distort perception, alter emotions and unbalance everyday life. It is an artistic representation of the constant struggle and effort to maintain control in the face of a destabilizing force. With ""Bitxo"", the artist seeks not only to express his own experience, but also to generate empathy and understanding towards those in similar situations, offering a window into the inner world of a person affected by addiction.Part of Responsive Dreams 2024 Festival5/6/7 September 2024Nau Dents de Serra, Roca Umbert Fàbrica de les Arts, Granollers, BarcelonaMore info: responsivedreams.com-NOTES:-not recomended for sound sensitive persons.-100% code generated (no images or sounds preloaded)-All audio stuff is done with WebPd (PureData). https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd-All visual is done with p5js -> https://p5js.org-MIDI stuff is done with WebMidi.js -> https://webmidijs.org-MIDI does not work with frames-> open the work in a new tab/window.-Chrome browser recommended.-MIDI compatible browsers -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API#browser_compatibility-It is recommended to use high quality sound equipment or headphones.-Supply can be halved/reduced if all iterations have not been minted (every week aprox)."

Primordial Soup,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/primordial-soup-2,working,"""Primordial soup"" is a term used to describe the hypothetical mixture of organic molecules that existed in the early Earth's oceans or other bodies of water, from which life is thought to have originated. This concept is a key component of theories about abiogenesis, which is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter.From this perspective, I like to think that randomness isn't just chaos; it's the raw material of creativity and complexity, much like the primordial soup was to the emergence of life. The generative algorithm acts as a guiding force, much like natural selection, which gradually shapes order from disorder. By filtering through countless possibilities, it discards those that cannot sustain themselves and nurtures those that show potential.Well-known noise functions serve as the groundwork, a fertile environment where patterns can emerge and evolve. They are the in-between state, not yet fully formed into something recognizable, but not entirely random either—just like the early molecules in the primordial soup, driven by chemical reactions towards more complex arrangements.Imagine these organic variants as seeds of potential, each with the possibility to grow into a new form of existence. Just as single-celled organisms once evolved into complex life forms, these primordial patterns, guided by the algorithm, could develop into intricate structures, digital ecologies, or even virtual ecosystems. They may give rise to digital 'organisms,' capable of self-replication, adaptation, or perhaps even rudimentary forms of perception and interaction.In this digital primordial soup, every bit of noise has the potential to become something greater. It's a playground for the formation of virtual life, where each small mutation, each random iteration, could lead to breakthroughs, much like how the first self-replicating molecules eventually paved the way for the vast diversity of life we see today.Made with love and p5js.Please enjoy in live fullscreen mode.Controls in fullscreen:[1] - save PNG 4000 × 2666[2] - save PNG 8000 × 5332[3] - save PNG 12000 × 7998[4] - save PNG 16000 × 10664"

Magma,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/magma-2,working,"This collection explores the generation of ""all"" 2D patterns of bitwise operators on a finite set of symbols.The algorithm will randomly pick, based on the contract seed, one integer smaller than 9007199254740991, this integer uniquely defines a bitwise operator. The minter controls 4 independent parameters: the numeral system base (finite set of symbols), and the fractal roughness. Fractal roughness is controlled by two parameters: the base and the exponent of the coarse graining operator. All these values are given as features once the NFT is minted.Surprisingly no fine tuning of the parameters where needed. Limiting the interval range of the allowed parameters values was the only aesthetically restriction imposed, mainly due to fxhash's variation algorithm. Because not all the parameters give good patterns some mild restrictions was needed. Other beautiful, but rare, spatial patterns exists on the far side of the parameters universe, but that's for another day.The algorithm is deterministic because it is based on deterministic bitwise operations on a finite alphabet. The list of all bitwise operators is called magma, hence the name of this NFT collection [1].One of the visual appealing parameters of the algorithm is the roughness exponent which is closely related to the fractal nature of the patterns produced. This roughness exponent shapes the resulting spatial pattern morphology, larger values of the exponent leads to coarser patterns, the inverse also happens, lower values of the roughness exponent leads to finer detail. These mathematically structures, patchwork quilts, are fractals with self-affine properties arising by simple bitwise operations between numbers.Colors are generated by converting the bitwise operator hyper-surface levels values to the 16777216 RGB color values in two ways.Also implemented is a coarse grain operator (CGO) that permits to morphologically zoom in and out of the pattern. The coarse grain operator has two parameters: a scale, parameter 'CGO scale' and an exponent, 'CGO exponent', that roughly specifies the magnitude of the coarse grain operator. 'CGO scale' equal to 1 (one) disables the coarse operator.Happy hacking!Completeness and determinism in algorithms are aesthetically categories that push into the limit of what can be described, fragile pedestals for our random existence.----[1] Vladimir García-Morales, Fractal surfaces from simple arithmetic operations,Physica A, Volume 447, 2016,Pages 535-544 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2015.12.028)Minting InstructionsBase: numeral systemRoughness: roughness exponentCGO scale: scale of the coarse grain operator (1=disables coarse operator)CGO exponent: magnitude of the coarse grain operatorOther palette: choose between two color palettesPress 's' to save a PNG (8192x8192px)."

Idle/Interludes,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/idleinterludes-1,working,"‘Idle/Interludes’ draws inspiration from the avant-garde experiments of 20th-century visual and concrete poetry, where the visual arrangement of text played an integral part in the poem’s meaning. Words transformed into shapes, with their physical presence on the page becoming as significant as their semantic content.The genesis of 'Idle/Interludes' began with my typewriter experiments. These early works sparked a deeper fascination with glyph compositions. I then reproduced the work using code to delve into dichotomous reflections. Open-source typewriter fonts, such as ‘Patrician’ and ‘Oliver Printype,’ became my building blocks.As the forms evolved, so did the phrases, mirroring the shapes. This iterative process—where brief, often binary or resonant phrases nest within a sea of glyphs—led to the continual addition and subtraction of patterns, letters, and symbols. Sometimes, these phrases stemmed from my personal experiences or the serendipity of phonetically or phonologically similar words. The idea lent itself well to generative art because of the malleability of language.The concept of visual poetry is especially powerful within the context of a book.

Shapes and colors are driven by Perlin noise* and randomness.I mapped 2D noise to shapes curvature and visualize also some noise contours.I also mapped three dimensional noise to RGB color components, so each point on the screen is the result of this mapping to random noise values. Removing the visual aspect and focusing only to the data layer, we have for each point on screen, a value between 0 and 1 with a smooth variation along to X and Y coordinates and a new value for its Z dimension, allowing us to have limitless levels of variation.Mapping these layers of variations to variables like color or other parameters, we can produce interesting visual representations of our numeric data.""The Beauty of Noise"" is an abstract 100% generative artwork based, as previously stated, on noise and randomness*Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1983.

Complex Assemblies,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/complex-assemblies,working,"THE PHASE EXPERIENCE EPISODE 0: COMPLEX ASSEMBLIES→ https://complexassemblies.danslesnuages.xyzWelcome to this new experience.None of the structures you are about to witness have ever been observed before. By running this program in your browser, you become the potential discoverer of new and previously unseen forms. Once the program starts, the autonomous algorithm will endlessly generate and interact with spatial configurations involving 15000+ elements.If a particular configuration catches your eye, press the SPACE bar to begin your exploration. The autonomous algorithm will pause, giving you the freedom to examine the structure from all angles, including from within.Your exploration vessel is equipped with two tools, accessible via the LEFT and RIGHT mouse clicks. These “entropy operators” allow you to interact with the structure's order. The left-click decreases the system’s entropy (increasing its order), while the right-click disturbs the elements along the operator’s path.Each time the program is launched, a similar experimental setup is generated, but with some unique characteristics. For example, we are working on developing an external non-perturbative light condenser (not an easy task!), but it doesn’t always function as expected.Additionally, the entropy operator accessed via left-click presents two variations: automatic or manual. In EXPLORE mode an entropy gauge appears in the lower-left corner of your screen. When the value reaches <0.01 nJ a new structure becomes available. We are also developing an automatic entropy operator, but it is only available in certain iterations.To switch between automatic and manual modes, simply restart the program with a new hash.This may all seem a bit random, and we apologize for any confusion. This new technology is still in its infancy, but rest assured that the entropy operators presented here are the most advanced currently available in the galaxy.By activating this program, you become the master of a unique physical experiment, where each observation could challenge the current state of knowledge. If you observe anything unusual or if a particular specimen seems noteworthy, feel free to take a screenshot using the ENTER key and submit it to us for further study. We encourage you to share the results of your observations and interactions by using the hashtag #thephaseexperience.

ANSITUNES,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/ansitunes,working,"My earliest exposure to digital art was viewing ANSI art on bulletin board systems, a scrolling, text-based experience over a slow dial-up connection. There's something alluring about the simplicity of a limited color palette rendered with 80 character columns of text. The computers back then were restricted to primitive hardware. Graphics cards could only render 256 colors at a time. Sound cards used on-board oscillators to produce a finite number of sound waves. And yet the creative genius of programmers pushed these limitations to magnificent results.ANSITUNES attempts to capture the spirit of that time. Using an elementary cellular automaton as the impetus, ASCII characters based on the code page 437 character set are rendered in VGA colors, and a chiptunes-style music score is generated using synth oscillators and noise algorithms. As the ANSI art scrolls, the music plays the ECA-generated song. Click or tap anywhere on ANSITUNES to start the song.On desktop, there are a number of keyboard commands available:[?] Show or hide the Help screen[SPACE] Play or pause ANSITUNES[M] Mute or unmute the audio[F] Toggle Fullscreen mode[C] Toggle the CRT effect[T] Export a TXT file (7680 rows max)[P] Export a PNG high resolution file (2560x1920)[W] Start and stop recording a WEBM audio file recording (3m max)ANSITUNES is built entirely with code, using p5.js, Tone.js, JavaScript, and GLSL."

Elliott Waves,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/elliott-waves,working,"This generative artwork, created using p5.js, is a sophisticated fusion of art, financial theory, and machine learning, designed to visualize and explore the intricate dynamics of financial markets through the lens of Elliott Wave Theory. Each piece produced by this code is more than just a visual artifact; it's a meticulously crafted, unique visual dataset ideal for training AI models in market analysis and prediction.Technical Overview:The core of the artwork is based on Elliott Wave Theory, a fundamental concept in technical analysis that posits markets move in predictable, wave-like patterns. The code generates these waves with random variations in height and width, emulating the inherent volatility and unpredictability of real-world market prices.Wave Generation: The code creates Elliott Waves by iterating over 360 days, where each day is represented by a small segment of the wave. Randomness is introduced in the direction and magnitude of the wave's movement, mimicking the erratic yet patterned behavior seen in financial markets.Candlestick Chart: To enhance the realism, the code generates weekly candlesticks, each representing a week's worth of data. The open, close, high, and low prices for each week are determined randomly, providing a visual representation of the market's fluctuations.Axes and Labels: The artwork is structured with a temporal x-axis marked by months and a quantitative y-axis indicating price levels. These axes not only provide context but are also essential for making the dataset relevant for AI training in temporal sequence prediction and financial forecasting.Randomness and Control: Randomness in this code is not merely a visual effect but a critical aspect of the data-driven approach. The randomness is carefully controlled to reflect the chaotic yet patterned nature of financial markets, making each iteration of the artwork a valuable and unique dataset.User Interaction:The code also includes a simple yet powerful user interaction feature: pressing the 's' key allows the user to save the current state of the artwork as a PNG file. This ensures that each unique iteration can be preserved for further study, display, or use in AI-driven applications.Applications:This generative artwork is not just a static piece; it's a dynamic, evolving dataset that serves multiple purposes:AI Training: The visual data produced is ideal for training AI models in market behavior, prediction, and analysis.Financial Analysis: The generated patterns and candlestick data can be used to explore and understand market dynamics.Artistic Expression: Each iteration of the code creates a visually compelling representation of market theory, bridging the gap between art and science.Conclusion:In this project, the randomness integrated into the artwork serves as a crucial component in emulating the behavior of financial markets. The result is a dynamic and evolving piece that not only stands as a visual masterpiece but also as a sophisticated dataset, ready to be used in AI-driven marketing strategies, financial analysis, and beyond. This makes the project a perfect blend of creative expression and cutting-edge technology."

This p5.js sketch is based on a photo I took of this movie theater building. I designed the entire building in code. That was tedious work! I did use a SVG file for the letters to avoid loading a font. Generative art has three advantages: interaction, randomization, and animation. I used randomization for the selection of movie posters, which are shown at random, and I animated the marquee lights to simulate chasing lights. The animation required some clever code. I used a few classes to draw repeating elements like the windows. Window placement could have been randomized but I wanted to recreate the look of the theater.This project is part of my effort to push generative art beyond the abstract to representation."

quantum | 2,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/quantum-or-2,working,"----- Generative art as a physics lesson: Quantum Time -------What is Quantum Time?Quantum time refers to the study of how time is represented and behaves at the quantum level. In classical physics, time is continuous and flows uniformly. However, in the realm of quantum mechanics, time can exhibit unique properties that challenge our traditional understanding. The concept of time becomes intertwined with the principles of quantum mechanics, leading to intriguing phenomena that are still the subject of ongoing research.Quantum Time and SuperpositionJust as particles can exist in a superposition of states, time in quantum mechanics can also exhibit superposition. This means that a quantum system might experience multiple timelines simultaneously until a measurement collapses these possibilities into a single outcome. This idea is linked to the concept of quantum entanglement, where the state of one particle instantaneously affects the state of another, regardless of the distance between them, suggesting a non-local connection that defies classical notions of time.Time in Quantum ComputingIn quantum computing, the manipulation of qubits involves precise control over quantum states, which includes their temporal evolution. Quantum gates, the building blocks of quantum circuits, operate in extremely short time intervals, and the coherence time of qubits—the duration for which they maintain their quantum state—is crucial for effective computation. Understanding and controlling quantum time is essential for developing reliable and efficient quantum computers.The Flow of Time in Quantum TheoryOne of the profound questions in quantum theory is how the flow of time emerges from the fundamental laws of physics. Some theories propose that time itself could be a quantum phenomenon, emerging from the entanglement and interactions of quantum states. This leads to fascinating possibilities, such as time being discrete rather than continuous, or the existence of multiple parallel timelines that could intersect and influence one another.By exploring quantum time, scientists hope to uncover deeper insights into the nature of reality and time itself, potentially leading to revolutionary advancements in technology and our understanding of the universe.The artwork is an example of my representation of the quantum world, capturing the mysterious and multifaceted nature of quantum time."

The device was constantly shifting and warping time in a way that they had never seen before. They could see moments from the past and future all at once, as if time was a fluid substance that it could manipulate at will.Even in the last few days before the rapture, when it was already clear that their own perception of time was being distorted, the consensus was that the device simply was some sort of particle analyzer.

It was causing tiny ripples in time that were slowly spreading throughout their world.They never really understood what happened to them.[…]–On display are 32 slices of rotating particles, caught in a finite time fragment. Each slice has an on and off state, which is controlled by the device. The device contains a piece of grid material that disperses energy. This energy feeds the morphing of time and controls the state of the slices.The rate through which the particles flow through time varies for each sequence. The particles are inherently chaotic, but the device continuously tries to find a transformation for stable analysis.The choreography consists of sequences that are based on recursive subdivision.

Twilight Blossoms,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/twilight-blossoms,working,"This artwork was created using JavaScript code. The piece, titled ""Twilight Blossoms,"" is inspired by the style of digital impressionism, a contemporary approach that combines the classic techniques of impressionism with the infinite possibilities of digital art.Digital impressionism is characterized by its loose brushstrokes and vibrant colors, capturing the essence of the scene rather than its precise details. In ""Twilight Blossoms,"" the goal was to capture the serenity and splendor of twilight through an explosion of colors and soft forms. The choice of crimson and orange tones for the sky aims to evoke the warmth and intensity of the setting sun, while the blues and greens in the flowers and landscape create a contrast that highlights the freshness of nature at dusk.The objective of ""Twilight Blossoms"" is to explore how technology can capture and express the ephemeral beauty of nature. Through code, the aim was not only to replicate a natural scene but also to infuse it with a sense of wonder and novelty. Each execution of the code can produce unique variations of the work, making each generated twilight as unique as those occurring in reality.This piece is a tribute to the fusion between human creativity and algorithmic precision, demonstrating that digital art can be both a tool for personal expression and a platform for infinite creative exploration.S: Save image in PNGI hope you like my first release on ETH(base),thank you all!"

Pop Eyes,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/pop-eyes,working,"Pop Eyes is a generative artwork rooted in the concept of ""fractions of the whole."" The canvas is initially divided into irregular, tessellated sections through a randomized process of dividing its edges into integer units. These sections are then further subdivided recursively, creating a complex network of interlocking spaces.Within each resulting space, a vibrant background color, reminiscent of Andy Warhol's iconic pop art palette, is applied. Overlaid on this background are four black ellipses, meticulously positioned to create a dynamic interplay of positive and negative space. The ellipses are carefully arranged to form a concentric-like pattern, allowing the underlying color to shine through in unexpected and visually striking ways.This interplay between the structured grid and the organic forms of the ellipses results in a piece that is both meticulously calculated and visually arresting. The final composition is a harmonious blend of Pop art aesthetics and Gestalt principles, inviting viewers to explore the intricate relationship between order and chaos.(c)2024 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec.

quantum | 1,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/quantum-or-1,working,"----- Generative art as a physics lesson: Superposition ------- What is Quantum Superposition? Quantum superposition is the principle that a quantum system can exist in multiple states at the same time until it is measured. Imagine a cat that is both alive and dead simultaneously until you open the box to check—this is known as Schrödinger's cat, a famous thought experiment. What is a Qubit? A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information, similar to a bit in classical computing. Unlike a bit, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a superposition of both 0 and 1. This property allows quantum computers to perform complex calculations more efficiently. Superposition in Quantum Computing Quantum superposition enables quantum computers to process a vast amount of information simultaneously. While a classical computer processes bits sequentially, a quantum computer can perform operations on all possible states of qubits at once. This parallelism gives quantum computers the potential to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.By harnessing the power of quantum superposition, scientists and engineers are developing new technologies that could revolutionize industries and solve previously intractable problems.The artwork is an example of my representation of the quantum world."

Revealed Secret,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/revealed-secret,working,"""Revealed Secret” is a generative art project that delves into the beauty and complexity that emerges when we look past the surface.  Our brains are trained to make quick judgements about people and things in order to assess danger and keep us safe.  But if we set aside our fear and take more time, we see that things are more complex and wonderous than they seemed at first.  The surface is blessedly broken and the hidden layers peak through to produce a fine tapestry of reality.  The project begins with a shader that creates three layers of Perlin noise.  An optional second shader smears the colors.  Then selected shapes are used to erase parts of the top two layers.  I’m delighted to finally use my own shaders to create art.  I’m borrowing shader noise code from Inigo Quilez and shader random code from Patricio Gonzalez Vivo.  Made with p5.js.After opening, use “s” to save the current image or 1 – 6 to produce different density jpg’s.

This NFT my realisation and interpretation of ""Subtraction”. Each iteration triggers an editor, allowing users to set parameters like the number of notes in a chord, the duration of the longest note, and the frequency range between notes. Each iteration creates one chord.You are invited to mint as many chords as you want, with each new chord building on the previous ones to form a continuous piece of music. Consider the parameters of previous chords when creating your iteration.

You can select from 5 to 50 notes.Frequency of the Root Note: Set the frequency of the root note, which is the starting note of your chord. This can range from 2 Hz to 500 Hz.Minimum Step Between Notes: Define the smallest possible random frequency difference between notes in your chord, ranging from 1 Hz to 500 Hz.Maximum Step Between Notes: Define the largest possible random frequency difference between notes in your chord, ranging from 1 Hz to 500 Hz.Duration of the Longest Note: Set how long the longest note in the chord will last.Loudness (chordLoudness): Adjust the volume of your chord.Tips for Composing Interesting ChordsVariety in Note Count: Experiment with different numbers of notes. A chord with 5 notes will sound much simpler in timbre compared to one with 50 notes, which can create a richer, more complex sound, but chords with less notes can be more striking for the harmony created by their intervals. Thus, the tradeoff is between the focus on timbre and the focus on harmony.Root Note Frequency: Use lower root note frequencies for deeper, bass-heavy chords, and higher frequencies for a lighter, more treble-focused sound.Steps Between Notes:Set a small minStep and maxStep to create closely spaced notes (possibly creating the beating effect). Use larger steps for a more open chord.Duration: Vary the duration of the longest note to change the feel of the chord. Shorter durations can make the piece feel more rhythmic and staccato, while longer durations add a more sustained and ambient quality.Loudness: Adjust the volume to create dynamics in your composition. Softer chords can be gentle and soothing, while louder chords can add intensity and presence. You cannot control the volumes of individual notes, which is (fxhash)-random. Just the general volume of the chord.Ideas for Composing a SequenceBuild Gradually: Start with fewer notes and lower loudness, gradually increasing these parameters with each new chord to create a building effect.Dynamic Shifts: Alternate between chords with high and low loudness or short and long durations to create contrast and keep the composition engaging.Harmonic Exploration: Experiment with different rootNote frequencies and steps between notes to explore various harmonic landscapes, from consonant to dissonant.Repeat: keep the params of the previous chords in multiple further iterations to maintain and evolve certain qualities of the musical fragment minted so far.By thoughtfully manipulating these parameters, you can craft a unique and evolving musical piece, contributing to a collaborative and continuous composition."

In the artfork, sinusoids and squares intersect, so we will talk about these waveforms.- Sine wave:A sine wave looks like a smooth, wavy line that rises and falls in a regular rhythm. It can be thought of as a perfect wave on water when there is no wind or other disturbances. It has smooth curves and no sharp changes. Such waves are often found in nature and technology. For example, the sound we hear and the electric current in our homes are mostly sinusoidal in shape.- Rectangular wave:A rectangular wave, on the other hand, looks like an alternation of straight horizontal lines that go up or down sharply. Imagine that you turn off and on the light in the room: either there is light, or there is no light. A square wave works in a similar way - it instantly changes its state from high to low and vice versa. This is often used in digital engineering and electronics, where signals need to be clear and understandable, such as ""on"" or ""off"".Is it strange that in the description of waves and physics we use the concepts of ellipse and rectangle?

I thought to myself, ""What if one of these doors could be like a hanging scroll of a landscape painting in the garden?The afterimage of the tape that peeled off the poster is like a wisteria trellis,Raindrops and shoe prints might look like flowers and grass in the garden.I fancied that the doors of the nearest station were like looking at a painting, and I stood there again and again.I disturbed the station staff for a long time.The passage of time moving in the direction of decay and fading,only by the replacement of colors,may be transformed into a growth process in which the plant is growing toward flowering.With this idea in mind, I started writing the code.A palette based on the colors of a garden, such as a Japanese garden, an English garden, etc., selected by random values,A palette reminiscent of a nightscape, a monochrome palette,palette that represents the deterioration of a door as it is.The palette is selected based on the colors of the garden, such as Japanese garden, English garden, etc.Four time modes are randomly selected: ""new"", ""normal"", ""old"", and ""vintage"".The number of events will change accordingly.Vintage has the most events.Every animation starts for about 1700 frames.You can save the png freely with the ""s"" key.This work was written in p5.js.I look forward to seeing a lot of output results.Thank you very much.Asahamiz"

Colorless spaces allow pure connections with forms and textures, revealing beauty in absence.By emphasizing the concept of 'Lost Spaces,' this work delves into parts of our being that are usually overlooked. 'Lost Spaces' reminds us of the opportunities that lie within absence or imperfection.

3 Body Problem,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/3-body-problem,working,"""3 Body Problem"" is a dynamic generative art piece that explores the complex and mesmerizing dance of celestial mechanics through digital simulation. Inspired by the astrophysical problem of predicting the motions of three celestial bodies interacting through gravitational forces, this artwork extends the challenge into a visually captivating experience.The viewer is invited to adjust the parameters to influence the number of orbiting bodies, their sizes, trails, and the speed at which they navigate the void of a customizable space. Each parameter choice significantly alters the visual composition, allowing endless variations of orbital paths that evoke the unpredictable nature of cosmic interactions.As bodies glide across the digital canvas, trails linger to mark the paths traveled, slowly fading like the memory of a shooting star. A black hole lies at the center, its event horizon and radiant glow dictating the gravitational ballet. Optional background settings let viewers choose between a serene gradient and a lively starfield, each enhancing the depth and feel of the space portrayed.""3 Body Problem"" is not only a tribute to the complexities of cosmic motion but also a meditation on the beauty of mathematical chaos and the art that emerges from it. It invites audiences to find their own meaning in the orbits that intertwine and evolve before their eyes, reflecting the ever-changing yet cyclic nature of the cosmos."

hexBOTs,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/hexbots,working,"*** hexBOTs ***You will love it - with a double click a new experiment starts!hexBOTs: Pushing the Limits of Cellular Automata Art.Controls:[hold finger down / hold mouse down] or [B]-keyenable/disable robotsPress the [I]-key. Then some information will be shown+ THE HOTKEYS.<<Naturally, you've just launched the program, and what you're seeing might strike you as ""pretty funny."" If you're looking for more than just ""funny,"" delve into the notes on 'hexBOTs.'At its core lies a grid, a parquet of equilateral triangles (seamlessly). This grid can also be transformed into a rectangular grid. This allows the slightly distorted representation of the triangle parquet to seamlessly integrate with the display grid.Now, considering a grid point of the triangle parquet, you find yourself amidst a center of six other grid points, positioning themselves in regular hexagons. In their center sits a robot surrounded by 6 points - hence the name 'Hexbot.'These robots move on this grid. They must always algorithmically choose one of the surrounding points as a new base point.The Track Module:Before a robot moves to the next grid point, it marks the point where it currently resides. Thus, a 'trail' is formed. These trails, along with others, paint the picture. However, the actual trail of the robot is not on the canvas but in its memory. After some time, the robot forgets its trail - it dissolves. The forgetfulness behavior of the trail is robot-specific and determined by the random generator. There are both weak and strong memory capacities. Everything will be forgotten!The Move Module:A robot now analyzes its 6 peripheral points, here, two of which are designated as trail-points. It reads 'false, false, true, true, false, false' or '001100' - binary = 12-decimal. The value 12 represents the index in the movement list of the robot - at this index in a fixed list stands, for example, 'Move to top left.' In total, there are always 64 list positions (0 - 63 / counting zero!), because with a 6-digit binary value, precisely the decimal numbers 0-63 can be defined. There are exactly six movement instructions: left, right, top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. These movement instructions are arranged in various variations in the 64-line movement list. Their positions are determined by the random generator. All possibilities result in a large number!The Stuck Module:The fact that a robot 'gets stuck' is a regular occurrence. Getting stuck can also manifest as a series of movements repeating periodically. If the Stuck Module recognizes motionlessness or a repetitive dance without progress, it triggers the 'Free Ride Mechanism.'10 to the power of 64 Robot Types:It was my decision NOT to host a TALENT SHOW to isolate 100 super-good robots. This results in the drawn pictures not always being so great, or often 'Dumb Robots' are on the playing field. Isolating only a few robot types would, however, have LOST A HUGE DIVERSITY! So: It doesn't always have to be a super show, but there are always new surprises! I want 10 to the power of 64 robots to have the chance to make their appearance!About the Program:A maximum of 53 robots are allowed. There have been instances where 24 different types were on the playing field. Various robots are deployed. The first robot is Type=0. When another robot is added, it becomes Type=1. If the same robot is added again, it also becomes Type=1. A brand-new robot is added - voilà Type=2 etc... etc... The programming of the types is different in each experiment. This means that identical types are completely different in different experiments.The concept of the entire event is perhaps a kind of 'jumble' of 'Game of Life' & 'Ants' + 'other grid-based designs.' In short: It's all stolen!Everything runs synchronously / one after the other - no parallel executions.My best regardsM. Schoenenberger>>"

Fragile Errors,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/fragile-errors,working,"""Art stands in a fragile balance; it reflects both its fragility and its strength.""Lucy Lippard In art, the concept of ""fragile"" emphasizes the delicate, sensitive, and brittle nature of works. This fragility can manifest in both the physical structure of the art and its emotional and conceptual depth. Additionally, the inclusion of mistakes and unexpected events in the artistic process lends a spontaneous and authentic quality to the pieces. These unplanned and uncontrolled errors can sometimes become the most powerful and impactful elements of the work. They reflect the fragility of the pieces and the complexity of the human experience, drawing the viewer more deeply into the inner world of the artwork. Ultimately, the concept of ""fragile"" and the spontaneous images created by mistakes are crucial elements that enhance originality and emotional depth in art. In this collection, I introduced a digital texture to my new compositions. I enveloped the resulting structures with an innovative layer and arranged the images spontaneously created by these textures in an interactive manner. I kept my color palette limited in this collection; I chose contrasting colors because textures become invisible in similar hues. During my resolution tests, I experienced significant texture loss at high levels, so I decided to work at an optimal resolution. This way, I aim to preserve both the visual richness and the artistic integrity of my works.*Save image: press 'W' to save the current image as a PNG.*Fullscreen mode: press 'E'------------------------------------------------------------------Fragile Errors © 2024 by NUBPLUS is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0"

Ode to Gestalt,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/ode-to-gestalt,working,"Ode to Gestalt is a mesmerizing exploration of form and color, reminiscent of the Bauhaus movement. The artwork is built upon a foundation of squares, each meticulously tessellated using three distinct shapes: a half-round, a quarter-round, and a petal.A vibrant palette of eight ""Bauhaus"" colors fuels the generative process. Four colors are randomly chosen to create a unique subset for each iteration. This subset then dictates the visual symphony: one color fills the background square, while another is selected to render one of the three shapes on top. The intrigue lies in the possibility of the background and shape aligning in color, causing the form to seemingly vanish, leaving behind a pristine square.The result is a captivating dance of color and form. Contiguous shapes, united by a shared hue, coalesce into intriguing structures, echoing the principles of Gestalt psychology.

Previously, I had used this algorithm in the Boxity project as well, but on a much smaller and simpler scale.I tried to use appropriate lighting from two directions to depict the cityscape.-----In each building, I aimed for a different exterior appearance from the others. This led to the creation of two categories of buildings: small and large. The larger buildings, fewer in number, shape the city and showcase its main appearance, representing real-world buildings. The smaller buildings, with more varied exteriors, were added primarily to create a sketchy feel to the city and represent small urban structures.IkiddoHope you enjoy the ""SketchScape""."

Thank you LoneWick for the challenge!The creative prompt made me think immediately of parasites, some of which get ingested in order to then devour their host from within. Applying conceptual simplification leads to the idea of self-parasitism where host and parasite are one and the same.One visual metaphor for this is the Ouroboros - the serpent that eats its own tail. For this project I've tried to merge an abstract version of Ouroboros with the Japanese symbol of ensō. In Zen Buddhism, ensō represents the circle of enlightenment, the void, and the infinite nature of existence. It is often depicted as an incomplete circle, symbolizing the idea that imperfection is an essential part of existence and perfection. Drawing ensō is a practice of spiritual reflection, self-expression, and mindfulness. It often reflects the state of the artist's mind at the moment of creation.Some compositions also show nested symbols of alternating colors. This, together with the broken circle which suggests a mouth, illustrates the phrase in another manner.--------------------------This is a 100% code generated project.Copyright 2024 Jeff Clark--------------------------Custom code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript."
Bit Operations,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/bit-operations,working,"🔈 Click for Sound 🔈Bit Operations is an visual exploration of computer fundamentals through bit-shifting operations. The visuals are generated by continuously shifting and combining binary patterns, resulting in evolving compositions of stark pixels and geometric shapes. The accompanying audio components are synthesized from this same modulating bit data.At its core, the piece is driven by algorithms that perform bit-shifting - the simple acts of pushing binary values left or right within the computer's memory. By combining multiple shifting patterns together in different ways, complex permutations of light and dark visuals emerge. The audio reflects these same bit-level operations, with the rhythms and tones mapping directly to the shifts occurring in the data.Through this formal process focused on bit-shifting, the piece lays bare the fundamental building blocks of how modern computers operate under the hood. It reduces computational logic to its most essential level - the manipulation of 1s and 0s through rudimentary shift operations. Yet from this simplicity, an infinite space of variations arises, both visually and aurally, highlighting the immense complexity potential within even the most basic digital operations."

The glow came from bioluminescent plankton, tiny organisms that transformed the dark waters into a sparkling spectacle. Each cresting wave released a cascade of brilliant blues and greens, as if the stars had fallen from the sky and taken refuge in the sea.Locals spoke of brightStar with reverence, their eyes lighting up with tales of wonder. They said that during the brightest nights, when the moon was full and the skies were clear, the waves would glow so intensely that one could read by their light. Children would run along the shore, their footsteps leaving trails of phosphorescence, and lovers would walk hand in hand, their paths illuminated by the ocean's soft radiance.For those who witnessed it, brightStar was a reminder of nature's mysterious beauty, a glimpse into a world where the ordinary became extraordinary.

Penetrate The Retina,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/penetrate-the-retina,working,"Until now, I have without hesitation given titles in English and written descriptions in English when exhibiting NFTs. However, they were not written in English. They were thought up in Japanese, which I use regularly, and then converted into English using a translation tool. I have continued to ignore what might have been removed in the translation process without thinking about it. In fact, through this work, I do not want to challenge the tendency for the fact that the world is English. I just wanted to clarify why I was putting out a work in Japanese on a platform that is not likely to have many Japanese people on it. I don't want to be reduced. I who inhabit this work never want to be sanded down and smoothed. These days I am confused. I have lost the social attributes that guarantee my identity, and I suffer from a troublesome disability and associated mental illness. By the way, let me tell you about an illness I developed last autumn. It is a conversion disorder. The symptoms of this illness vary from person to person, but to my surprise, my body stops working! It is a mental illness, yet I experienced days of being bedridden, unable to walk, and struggling to hold anything. Recently I have been blessed with a good doctor and medication and am recovering quite well, but it is not completely gone. But I am still able to type and create! It's wonderful. Whether I wanted to or not, my life was not going well. On top of that, the world was a mess. I wanted to fight, to raise my voice, but obstacles prevented me from doing so. I was frustrated and angry at my powerlessness. Before that, I was unemployed, the country was tough on the mentally disabled and I didn't know how to live. I had to make NFT, otherwise I wouldn't be able to earn money. But I didn't know how to organize my confusion as a work of art, so I spent my days in agony. If the confusion is who I am, I don't have to go to the trouble of cutting it down. It was this kind of resignation that led me here. The words that appear in the work are taken from my diary over several months, posts on social networking sites, and things from my life. I am no longer there. I am back to where I am now.

off-meta,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/off-meta,working,"Exploring what it means to be human, “off-meta” challenges us to reconsider our pursuit of perfection, conformity, and meeting others’ expectations. “off-meta” embraces life’s happy mistakes and finds joy in the imperfect, the minimal, and the worn. This artwork invites viewers to reflect on their lives, highlighting the extraordinary in the ordinary and showcasing the allure of being just a little ‘off-meta’. In “off-meta,” we are reminded that our imperfections are not flaws to be hidden but aspects to be celebrated. By embracing the off-meta, we celebrate our true selves—messy, beautiful, and wonderfully human.I am incredibly grateful to my collectors for their unwavering support throughout this journey.

Culminate,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/culminate,working,"Since Base was launched on the NFT network, I have been thinking about releasing the AlgoRect*2 project on this blockchain with some changes and a sketchier appearance. In fact, 'culminate' here means the final and fully developed version of AlgoRect*2.In this project, I actually used the algorithm employed in AlgoRect*2 but with some modifications. The coloring of the elements has been replaced with another algorithm. Additionally, to give a sketchier form to the project, I added a type of uncolored elements around the main project. The canvas size has been changed to 2000*2000 pixels in order to capture an image with more details from the project."

All Those Moments,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/all-those-moments,working,"'All Those Moments' intricately examines how memories evolve—stretch, distort, and blend over time. This artwork delves into the intricate nature of memory, reflecting how specific experiences remain vivid and detailed while others become hazy or fade into obscurity. It captures the fluidity of recollection, where the passage of time can alter our perceptions, merging past events into a seamless narrative or fragmenting them into disconnected pieces. The work also contemplates the fragility of memory, acknowledging the inevitable degeneration that can occur, particularly through conditions like dementia. This series evokes the emotional landscape of remembering and forgetting, inviting viewers to reflect on their own fleeting moments and enduring memories. In portraying the delicate balance between enduring and fading memories, 'All Those Moments' underscores how our personal histories shape our identity and worldview.Made with love and p5js.The code of this artwork is dimension-agnostic.Controls:[1] - save PNG at the current resolution[2] - save PNG 2666 × 4000[3] - save PNG 5332 × 8000 [4] - save PNG 7998 × 12000"
When You're Alone.,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/when-you're-alone.,working,"I spend a lot of my time alone. I like it.This project is part drawing system, part isometric challenge, and part artwork.The artwork is pleasantly laid out before the viewer as an empty city of thousands of buildings slowly comes to fruition for the imagination to fill.The drawing system is showcased through a keyboard accessible menu (press the [m] key) where you can fine-tune how well, or badly, you want your city drawn. You'll notice the menu auto-updating to conform to the new drawing parameters as you change them. Initially I planned to have random drawing parameters assigned per edition, but found myself gravitating towards a cleaner look so often, I decided to make it the default, so the collection was more cohesive across outputs, and include controls within the piece for alternate versions, (for better or worse drawing skills) if you so choose. The menu system for this is a nice addition I think as well. NFTs can be so much more than just a jpeg.Conventions have been made for removing the hatch lines (press [h] to toggle during drawing) as well as a pointillism feature (press [.] to toggle during drawing) for fun.When You're Alone is entirely drawn with straight lines. There are no shapes used. Nothing curved. Just lines. This became important to me.Controls While Drawing----------------------[m] = access the drawing menu[?] = the list of keyboard commands[p] = Pause the drawing[r] = restart the drawing[↓] = slow down the rendering[↑] = speed up the rendering[h] = toggle hatching[.] = toggle pointillism[1] = 4k resolution (default)[2] = 8k resolution[3] = 16k resolution[x] = quickly randomize drawing parameters (also works within drawing menu)[s] = save .pngDrawing Menu----------------------The interplay of the five drawing parameters, combined with the scale and lot size of the city, can lead to intriguing variations, enhancing the original's appearance and feel. A brief description of each.Pure Drawing Skill - This is the most important factor in the final look and feel of the drawing. It can overcome a lot, and can not be overcome by much.Concentration - This decides how long the computer can hold a straight line without drifting one way or the other along the path.Pen Pressure Consistency - The more consistent, the more even the weight of the line will be. Less consistent lines will appear more broken, especially when combined with a fast drawing speed. This may be a look that is appealing or not.Drawing Speed - This sort of bleeds into all of the other variables and decides how much or little impact their relative weights have on the final product. In addition, the slower the drawing, the more ink that bleeds onto the page giving a darker look to the drawing.Pen Nib Size - The actual size of the pen tip/nib that the computer will use. Thinner nib, thinner lines.Features-------------Building Density: Dense/Normal/SparseLot Spacing: Jammed/Crowded/ComfortableCenter Downtown: Yes/NoDowntown Style: Clustered/SprawlingMax Lot Size: 2-9Street Spacing: 2-9Alley Spacing: None/Tight/Normal/BroadScale: Tiny/Small/Medium/LargeHatching Style: Normal/ContrastI believe gen-art gives the artist a unique opportunity to use animation. Not explicitly in the final product perhaps, but to show the image coming to life. It was important to me to display the city being drawn structure by structure, and I consider it integral to this project in particular, as there is a certain mesmerizing aspect to watching the empty city come to be.Hopefully, you can always find something new.Made with: p5.jsLicense: When You're Alone © 2024 by 6ixty is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

sola,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/sola,working,"""Sola"" is an abstract artwork that explores the theme of loneliness and its necessity in modern thought through the interplay of lines, circles, and squares. The minimalist composition uses stark contrasts and subtle nuances to evoke a sense of isolation within an expansive, empty space. The lines, representing the fragmented and often disconnected nature of contemporary life, intersect with circles and squares that symbolize moments of introspection and the barriers we face in connecting with others. ""Sola"" suggests that loneliness, while challenging, is essential for personal growth and self-awareness, encouraging viewers to see solitude as a space for creativity and deeper understanding in a chaotic world."

In the period when the earth speaks of itself with a call of love and passion in every moment of life. When the heart sinks into the past, each emotion has its people. Here, feelings, thoughts, and ideas shine in an endless beam of time, each drop of which has a deep immersion in the vast sea of the past and experiences. A place where borders are erased and people connect with the earth. That bright spot in time and place reminds us that we are all part of a bigger story. Events that are connected from beginning to end are always ongoing and have eternity and beauty. From thousands of years ago until today, nature has shown endless displays of its special beauty. I want to talk about its sedimentary textures and its various colors, signs of an infinite path of time, and natural changes that have affected it, and each piece of it tells a mysterious story of its journey through time; From its formation in the depths of the seas and rivers to the emergence on the surface of the earth. A natural miracle, which, with its beauty, draws us to a world of greatness and wonder. Grooves that scream from the depths of time remind us that everything in this world is an infinite and beautiful journey, and we are part of this great world.Perhaps it is a symbol of beauty and stability in the stone world. Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.And finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history.

Each wave is defined by a center point and utilizes different distance calculation methods. As the code loops through these waves, it computes the distance between a specified point and each wave center, determining the amplitude of interference. By summing up these amplitudes, constructive and destructive interference effects are simulated. The resulting interference pattern is normalized and mapped to a color palette.This exploration into wave interference patterns serves as a study in aesthetic ontology, sparking contemplation on the subjective aspects of aesthetic experience and whether or not perfect, immutable and mathematical forms of beauties, or 'archetypes', exist.

ConcretionX144X160,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/concretionx144x160,working,"This new collection, a collaboration between Sha22, Fleurman & Raoul Pictor, is unveiled at the Mapping Festival Geneva 2024.In “ConcretionX144X160” Raoul Pictor explores the expressive potential of pixels in a 144 x 160 pixel format with four shades, reminiscent of the legendary Game Boy console. These pixels not only delineate the physical framework of the work; they also create the world in which Raoul lives and works.Represented with his computer, Raoul becomes the symbol of an era where the artist and the tool merge into one. Coded to code, Pictor reflects the recursive loop of digital creation where the virtual artist, himself a series of commands and scripts, generates art through his own programming language. He challenges the acronym WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) by revealing an art of programming where the final artwork remains hidden behind the veil of code. He is both the brush and the painter, the algorithm and the craftsman, exploring the boundaries of a reality where the tangible and intangible coexist. The distinction between creator and creation dissolves in this digital space, prompting viewers to recognize art not only as the product of a process but also as an introspective reflection of the technology that shapes it.The generated creations juxtapose the virtual and the physical world through the depiction of a pixelated sculptural form, a concretion, made up of abstract three-dimensional elements that suggest the weight of traditional materials from our reality.Instructions:[p], [mouse click], [touch screen] : Save the painting when it is displayed.[esc], [double click on computer] : r.p. computer crashes"

Atomic Radiation,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/atomic-radiation,working,"Atomic Radiation: A Generative Exploration of Mid-Century ModernityA Fusion of Past and Present:This generative art piece, ""Atomic Radiation,"" reflects my fascination with Mid-Century Modern (MCM) design, a style that resonated deeply during my Industrial Design studies from 1965 to 1969. Revisiting this aesthetic serves as an exploration of my artistic roots and a celebration of the design influences that shaped me.Echoes of Modernism:MCM design drew heavily from modern movements like Scandinavian Design and the Bauhaus. It championed clean lines, honest use of materials, and a minimalist approach that shunned excessive ornamentation.Generative Interpretations:As a generative artist, I leverage the power of code to effortlessly create MCM design elements – think of them as artistic building blocks. These elements are then arranged in patterns or layouts, often utilizing tessellations (a method for creating seamless, interlocking patterns) inspired by György Kepes' ""Language of Vision"" – itself an embodiment of the Bauhaus philosophy within the MCM movement.The Art of the Algorithm:The backdrop of ""Atomic Radiation"" is a dynamic canvas. Its wavy structure incorporates subtle random variations while adhering to a limited palette reminiscent of Bauhaus color theory. Colors are randomly chosen, and the interplay of the oscillating vertical lines creates a mesmerizing visual effect. An overlay of atomic widgets, a quintessential MCM motif, forms a captivating, interlocking structure. Each widget, empowered by code and controlled randomness, becomes unique – distinct in color, number of orbits, and electron placement.A Dynamic Experience:The true magic of ""Atomic Radiation"" lies in its interactive nature. With a simple key press, the entire composition refreshes, generating a new, original piece of generative art. Each iteration offers a fresh perspective on the fusion of MCM aesthetics and contemporary artistic expression."

This piece was created during the GW of 2024. Please consider the following note as a miscellaneous reflection born from heightened concentration during this period.Initially, on a whim, I was sketching the circular and radiating lines from Marcel Duchamp's ""The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even"" using p5js. I managed to reproduce the circular elements quite satisfactorily with algorithms and felt content with that.On another occasion, as a completely separate endeavor, I was experimenting with a technique of creating forms using a grid. With plenty of time during the holiday, I had ample opportunity for exploration. However, at one point, this formation somehow adopted a configuration reminiscent of ""The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even"". Intrigued, I decided to experiment by duplicating this formation, placing it both in the upper and lower halves. This resulted in the completion of this piece.Through this process, I feel I gained insight into Duchamp as a Generative Artist. His Rotoreliefs, naturally, along with his series of ""Nude Descending a Staircase"" and his interest in chess, all began to appear as facets of Generative Art. However, I fear this sensation may slip away if not acted upon promptly.

Displaced,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/displaced-1,working,"In a realm where precision was law and uniformity was the canvas of existence, there was an enigmatic artist known only as the ""Architect of Order."" His world was one of impeccable lines and predictable patterns, where each building, each street, each life was a mirror image of the other — a world that had never known the chaos of difference.The Architect's life was dedicated to creating the perfect city, a testament to the power of order. But deep within, there stirred a quiet, unacknowledged yearning — a whisper of something different. One evening, as twilight melded into the shadows, the whisper became a voice, and the Architect began to create something new.He worked through the night, guided not by his usual precise calculations but by a newfound rhythm that pulsed with the beat of his own heart. When dawn broke, the city awoke to a sight unseen: a singular building unlike any other, with blocks displaced and patterns disrupted.The ""Displaced"" building, as it came to be known, stood as an anomaly. Its asymmetry was a stark contrast to the uniformity of its neighbors. Whispers turned into conversations, and conversations into debates. The city was divided; many saw it as a flaw in the fabric of their perfect world, but for others, it was a revelation.Among the city's inhabitants was a young girl who had always felt out of place in the rigidity of her surroundings. To her, the ""Displaced"" was a symbol of hope, a message from the Architect that there was beauty in irregularity, and that it was okay to be different.The building sparked a movement. People started to add splashes of color to their homes, plant gardens of wildflowers in rigid rows, wear clothes that clashed with geometric precision. The city, once a monochrome of sameness, was now erupting with color and life.The ""Displaced"" stood as a testament to the beauty of imperfection and the power of a single act to inspire change. The Architect, once revered for his unwavering adherence to order, was now celebrated for his courage to imagine beyond it. And the young girl, who had found her reflection in the displaced blocks, became the Architect's apprentice, learning to build not just with her hands, but with her heart.The city had transformed, not into a place of perfect order, but into a mosaic of individuality, where every building had its story, every street its rhythm, and every life the freedom to find its unique pattern in the grand design. The ""Displaced"" was no longer an outlier but the cornerstone of a new world — one where every displacement was an opportunity for wonder, and every irregularity a doorway to possibility.—-Press [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .pngMade with p5.jsRob Scalera | 2024"

Week After Week,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/week-after-week,working,"Week After Week is a collaboration between Whitekross (Alessandro Fiore) & the Waiting To Be Signed podcast. We have known Alessandro for some time now and have loved collecting his work over the years, so it is fitting that we are finally coming together to release a project. Week After Week celebrates commitment & 'doing the work', something we have come to embrace after making the show for 2+ years and scarcely missing an episode... despite having two babies in that time! It also honors the discipline and practice that all artists are committed to as they continue to explore their style, develop (and sometimes abandon) projects & ideas, and push forward with each new release. Though we originally intended to incorporate audio from the show in some way, we discarded that idea to ensure the project would feel diverse enough to support a long-form release. Instead we have drawn on WTBS episode titles, phrases & references in general as naming for the features of the project. We hope you will collect firstly because you love the art and secondly, because you are fans of Whitekross or WTBS (hopefully both).Big thanks to Alessandro for taking the time to work on a collab in support of the show! We are thrilled with how it came out and we are excited to collect ourselves 🙂Thanks also to the fx(hash) team as well for working with us to get a Frame set up for minting on Farcaster & encouraging us along the way.----Press ""s"" to save a PNG output.----Thanks to:# P5.jshttps://github.com/processing/p5.js# Hobby Curvehttps://github.com/arnoson/hobby-curve# Boilerplatehttps://github.com/mattdesl/tiny-artblocks# GLSL Simplex Noise https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise# GLSL Blend Modehttps://github.com/jamieowen/glsl-blendSee license.md for licensing details."

The ring symbolizes the cyclical and repetitive nature of the universe. The patterns that make up our lives and the world around us are the foundation of endless possibilities. Each piece creates a network of spokes that connect to points on the rings. The spokes introduce an element of chance and dynamism. The interplay between order and chaos creates a visual language that hints at paths taken and unseen networks.The specific pathways and they the way they interact within each piece are unique. This variation invites the viewer to contemplate the unseen: the potential narratives suggested by the paths, the destinations beyond the ring, and the stories whispered by the empty spaces between.That could also be a load of manure.

While we grasp the technical definition, no one possesses the faintest notion of what occurs to an individual after they pass away.Personally, I've always been fascinated by the idea of death. Since I was a child, I've found myself empathizing with the suffering of others and who I am today has been shaped by the losses I've experienced in my life.To bring this project to life I gathered my thoughts and memories and I coded nightly to visually represent the felt experience of the mystery of death, intentionally using a single line to symbolize life's continuity, from start to finish.As the project progressed, I realized the multitude of perspectives surrounding the subject. From losing a loved one to facing our own demise, from being on death row to dying while saving someone else. Whether dying young or after a long, fulfilling life. The pain of losing a child, the weight of taking another's life, the grief of losing a pet, or even the simple act of killing a mosquito—what lies beyond? How long can an object hold a memory? Can it transcend the rituals of ceremony, the solemnity of cemeteries, the grandeur of mausoleums?I invited eight artist friends to participate in this project by contributing a short phrase, or poem capturing a facet of their feelings about death. I then visually riffed on each submission.There are a total of 16 different profiles, each appearing 5 times but never identical. Each output will enable its owner to redeem a physical plot at an additional cost. This means there could be a maximum of 5 signed and numbered plots for each profile in existence, all unique.I would like to express my deep gratitude to Atelier Art for organizing the Visual Poetry exhibition and assisting me every step of the way, both in helping me articulate what I truly wanted to convey and in executing the concept effectively. In the end, the beauty of an art practice truly lies in the human connections it fosters.A special thanks goes to my fellow artists who participated in enriching this journey:Æther               @aethersovereignAlessandro Fiore    @whitekrossHarvey McFly        @HarveyMcFlyPaul Prudence       @MrPrudencePureSpider          @PureSpiderQUBYT               @qUBYt2santiago            @neymrqzSh!g                @shig_nft--------------------------------------- Press 1,2,3 or 4 to re-render the artwork at progressively higher resolution- Press S to save a PNG image of the artwork- Click and drag over the image to adjust the drawing speed of the line- Double-click on the image to restart the drawing process from the beginning--------------------------------------Dedicated to my great friend Vale, who knows when to tell me to shut the fuck up."

Random Access Memories,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/random-access-memories-1,working,"Random Access Memories invites you on a voyage of remembrance. Crafted from my own memories,  fragments of sentences float in and out of view, some easily graspable, others more blurry or barely legible.I grew up in an analog world but always worked in a digital one. My memories are somewhere in between the two realms: half computer bits, and half scents, scenes and sounds. RAM is not just about me, it’s also an attempt to connect my memories to your own by taking you on an inner journey: What words did you read first? Where did they take you? What story arises, and what memories resurface?RAM points you in a number of directions, ultimately the journey is your own.Developed in p5js and WebGL for Atelier’s group show, Visual Poetry 2024, Random Access Memories is my 3rd long-form generative collection.Keyboard Functions:‘s’ saves a png image of the current screen‘spacebar’ pauses / resumes default rotation‘e’ / ‘d’ enables / disables the depth buffer (try it!) mouse / trackpad  drag to manually rotate the image and discover hidden facets of the cube."
Hash Pop,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/hash-pop,working,"Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. ‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? The structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  There is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. ‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project.

In between being proud and lacking sleep, I felt ‘Scream, from atop’ creeping up my thoughts like a recurring dream, at times drawing me closer but others pushing me away.Conceptually it’s a bit of an evolution from ‘soft spot’, with whom it shares a few similarities under the hood. For this,  I combined 15 color palettes with 7 possible compositions. Although they don’t all work flawlessly together, I’ve witnessed many interesting and surprising combinations emerge.At some point, I figured that it was ok for this project not to be afraid of its shortcomings. But to search in vulnerability for a relatable place, with genuine assumptions and comfort.

The spokes introduce an element of chance and dynamism. The interplay between these two forces - control and chaos - creates a visual language that hints at journeys taken and unseen connections.The specific pathways within each piece are unique. This variation invites the viewer to contemplate the unseen: the potential narratives suggested by the paths, the destinations beyond the frame, and the stories whispered by the empty spaces between."

Blue Lines,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/blue-lines,working,"""Blue Lines"" is an exploration of the interplay between order and chaos, utilizing the random walk algorithm.I was continuously engaged in drawing alongside creating Generative Art pieces. Gradually, I became interested in incorporating the concept of randomness generated by computers, which I experienced in the production of Generative Art, into my own drawings. The idea was to actively integrate randomness into the physical control of my drawing process. I use a blue pen (my favorite is the ZEBRA brand's marker ""マッキー極細"") and make time for drawing whenever possible. Sometimes, I even involve my pet cat in the drawing process, creating drawings through interactions with the cat. This ""Blue Lines"" is a work that simulates my computer-inspired drawings on the computer again. By using the computer-generated work as a base and adding more drawings to it, it becomes possible to co-create with both the computer and humans.Randomness is probably one of the keys to serendipity.Therefore, one way to use this piece is to print it out and have collectors add their own drawings to it. By layering hand-drawn elements onto the computer-generated base, ""Blue Lines"" becomes a canvas for collaboration, where human creativity and algorithmic randomness converge.1696 × 1200 px on Thumbnails5088 × 3600 px on Live View Modep5jsApril 1,2024hasaqui"

Neutrality of the rotten root,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/neutrality-of-the-rotten-root,working,"Neutrality can be problematic because, by avoiding taking a stance, one can ignore existing inequalities and injustices. This can lead to a false equivalence between unequal arguments and, consequently, distort the truth of the whole. Furthermore, neutrality can mask one's own prejudices and beliefs, preventing a complete and honest understanding of the facts. As an artist, I embrace neutrality in my abstract art to serve as a mirror for the viewer's own experiences and emotions. By maintaining a neutral stance, I invite a broader range of interpretations, making the art more accessible and personal to each individual who encounters it.

Budokan,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/budokan,working,"Budokan is a simple algorithm that can produce complex and nuanced outputs.Budokan is a battle between two different patterns with two different color palettes (one acting as a shader, the other as the base palette) mixed together in different ways. Additionally, each pattern/palette combination undergoes a color shift by one at evenly set intervals, which creates a tiled appearance, or when the patterns overlap, as determined by the style of each output.Palette colors are shifted either along the x-axis, y-axis or both the x/y-axis.The shaders are either simple black and white, or a gradient from black to white and may be mixed at different strengths (Shader Mix Power) with the base palette.The patterns, based on noise fields, are interpreted at different scales (tiny, small, medium, large, jumbo) which affects how granular the patterns that the noise field generates are.The artwork is fully responsive and scales to whatever size your gpu can handle. By default the browser window's height is used to inform the canvas height and the width is based off of one of three aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 3:4).Styles--------Contrast - The shader is a different pattern and mixed with the base palette.Harmony - The shader is the same pattern and mixed with the base palette.Overlay - The shader is a different pattern and is used to determine color shifts in the base palette. The shader palette is also mixed with the base palette.Alternating - The shader is the same pattern, and palettes alternate tiles.Shaders---------Gradient vs B & W/W & B - Gradient shading will have a more textured, painted look as opposed to the flatter look of the single color black and white palettes.W & B vs B & W - W & B shaders are heavier in whites. Same with white gradient shader.

The dot, however, finding the line stiff, dull, and conventional, turns her affections toward a wild and unkempt squiggle. Though dejected, the line was not without determination, and, after much concentration, managed to bend himself, giving rise to shapes so complex he had to letter his sides and angles to keep his place. Before long he was able to express himself in any shape he wished, from helices to spider webs to Paul Klee's little jester. Overwhelmed by the line's geometric contortionistic prowess, the dot realized that what she had seen in the squiggle to be freedom and joy was nothing more than chaos and sloth. Thence, the line and the dot lived ""if not happily ever after, at least reasonably so."" The story ends with a punning moral: ""To the vector belong the spoils.""Through the power of Generative Art I'm giving Squiggle another chance.The spurned Squiggle has not given up on Dot. He has matured and developed a calligraphy. He uses it to create visual poetry hoping to catch Dot's attention and to rekindle lost love and win her back from Line.

Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of basic modules, or 'monads', that are combined and transformed through an algorithmic process to generate a unique generative artwork.In philosophy, the term 'monad' was used by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz to describe the basic and indivisible unit of reality. In generative art, the term 'monad' refers to the simple elements that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create artworks.Pioneers of generative art, such as Vera Molnar, Michael Noll, and John Whitney, experimented with the use of algorithms to generate artworks. These artists developed computer programs and mechanical systems that used simple patterns and shapes to create complex and dynamic artworks. In this context, 'monads' became the fundamental building blocks of these generative artworks.In the Monad 1960 Part Two collection, programming and algorithmic design are used to generate unique artworks that reflect the principles of the generative art movement. Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of 'monads' that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create a unique generative artwork, exploring the relationship between the simplicity of the 'monads' and the complexity of the resulting generative artworks.Features:This collection is created 100% with code, using only the JavaScript canvas. It has 8 color palettes available and over two thousand possible combinations for the algorithm to draw a unique piece.

BEHOLDER,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/beholder-1,working,"Description:Flowers, sunsets, temples, factories, grids, circuits, faces, shadows. What do you see?Method:BEHOLDER is an ode to entropy locking. A simple grid based system is used to draw ""circles"" and ""rectangles"" (hard to exactly call them that), using colors sampled from elsewhere in the grid, according to entropy-locked random rules. The size and shape of the grid, which colors and shapes to draw, and even how the colors will mutate, all is determined according to pure uniform random noise. The resulting emergent structure is a result of the entropy locking. Since entropy locking is unpredictable, there is also a check that regenerates the image if the generated frame color is pure white. This usually happens because the entropy lock simply never locked (it's random), resulting in a pure white output. If this happens, a super dumb trick is used to regenerate the image deterministically using the same hash but a different ""slice"" of the rng.BEHOLDER demonstrates the power of emergent behavior to create interesting patterns. With very limited code and rules, interesting visuals can be summoned from the void like magic. I setup BEHOLDER to mostly create ""bright moments"", little samples of shapes and colors that make me feel good to look at. Occasionally a stunningly clear shape or face arises, enjoy it if you see it, but know that others might not agree.Controls:s -> save a png of the outputn -> advance to the next frame... tap it over and over, see what happens, you'll get a feel for the algorithm"

The backdrop is a grid-like structure that speaks to the underlying coordinate system, a fundamental element in computational graphics and design.The perimeter is defined by an explosion of fine, colored lines, each propelled by a set of parametric equations that govern their direction, length, and hue. These strings stand in stark contrast to the controlled serenity of the center, providing a visual representation of the generative algorithm's range—from the delicate balance of the core to the dynamic extremities.Press [S] to save a .png file in full view.D.__________________________________March 2024."

Polako,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/polako,working,"""Polako"" means ""slowly"" in Montenegrin. When I first came here, the word I heard most often when I wanted to do something with someone or ask them for something was ""Polako."" In the culture I grew up in, everything happened very quickly and was results-oriented. In my new city, it's the opposite. Things may move slowly, requiring patience, but the aim is for better results. Perhaps they're right; the longevity of quickly done things is debatable. Our contemporary culture is like that too, everything is based on consumption. Art fields are also affected by this trend. Many artists or works without a past become popular with instant attention and then disappear after a while. This is sad in the long run. But when artists who don't get the recognition they deserve face these situations, they question themselves and their art, feeling inadequate and unsuccessful. As someone who has experienced this a lot, I am a keen observer. But speed is not necessary. What's important is to be lasting. Yes, this is very difficult. It's really hard to endure life and make your production sustainable. I must be patient. I need to mature my ideas. Slower, more polako. Surely, our art will be appreciated. There is a hidden connection between slowness and faith.In this collection, I have returned to my architectural world once again. I have designed new compositions for depth.

Unmanageable,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/unmanageable,working,"In ""Unmanageable,"" I undertake a profound journey into the heart of life's intricacies. This endeavor serves as my expressive outlet, where I reveal with a profound sense of awareness the truth I've discovered:Control is a mere illusion, revealing that ultimately, everything, when you get down to it, is… unmanageable.This insight was hard-earned, shaped by the trials of life, stretching across its wide and stormy expanse.I learned that every job is fundamentally about humans, about our interactions, emotions, and the unpredictabilities that come with them. It's a space where logic often gives way to the unmanageable nature of human relationships. Every expression of joy or frustration, every miscommunication, has offered me deep insights into the intricate web of human connection—complex and poignant in its reality.Finding a fulfilling romantic relationship is often attributed to luck. Yet, 'luck' scarcely encompasses the turbulent flow of connections and disconnections shaping our bonds. I count myself fortunate in love, yet this fortune comes intertwined with complex emotions, with moments of intense happiness shadowed by the fear of loss, creating a deeply emotional experience that touches the very core of my being.I've wrestled with the market – deciding on supply, price, and facing down the haunting shadow of imposter syndrome. It's a realm where unpredictability reigns supreme. I find myself in a constant comparison with others, better or worse, only to realize, in the end, it’s all unmanageable. This constant comparison, this relentless self-scrutiny, is a journey fraught with doubts and triumphs, each leaving their indelible mark on my soul, a story etched in every line of my work.Even money, especially in its digital, internet-driven form, eludes true grasp and understanding. It’s a nebulous world, where value shifts in the blink of an eye, often leaving more questions than answers, a reflection of the fleeting nature of what we hold valuable.And then there's time, ever fleeting, always escaping. It slips through my fingers like grains of sand, a poignant reminder of the ephemeral nature of our existence, of moments that pass before we can truly grasp them.Yet, there’s another layer to this unmanageable world – the way we consume and interact with content. People don’t read anything thoroughly anymore. E-mails, tweets, descriptions like this one, often go unnoticed in the whirlwind of information overload. We live in an era where content is devoured in short video form, fleeting and fast, leaving little room for the depth and contemplation that written words offer. This shift is indicative of the chaotic pace of our lives, where immediacy often overshadows depth, and the meditative quality of reading is drowned out by the constant barrage of visual media.In ""Unmanageable,"" I challenge this trend. By presenting my thoughts and experiences in a format that demands engagement beyond the superficial glance, I invite viewers to pause, to delve deeper than the ephemeral video clip. This project is a fragment of my soul, a narrative of my journey, laid bare for the world to see, in all its unmanaged, raw, and sincere form.Press [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png on live modeClick to unpause/pause animationMade with p5.jsRob Scalera | 2024"

Each piece is a fusion of past and present, a kaleidoscopic explosion of form and color that captures the essence of an era and reimagines it for the modern age.------Pierre Comet"

I’ll describe it briefly: Broken pieces of glass are taken and polished on a grinding machine. Then each processed fragment is wrapped very tightly along the edge with copper tape. These elements are used to create mosaics or a chaotic pattern. Next, molten tin is applied to the copper tape using a soldering iron. Cooled tin on a copper strip forms a dense metal frame where the glass is fixed. The result is real stained glass.

When deciding what to wear, signals of identity, culture, place, time, values, memories, and so much more always trickle through. Spellbound embeds these personal signals in a scarf to keep you or a loved one warm.Using the fxhash params feature, you can record a voice note that will generate a unique scarf design. Record a message for a friend, your favorite song, or a quote you want to live by; get creative. After minting your token, you can redeem your scarf.Spellbound is the first fxhash project combining personalized on-demand fashion and generative art, pushing towards a more unique and sustainable future of fashion. Spellbound creates singular designs within a broader collection, resulting in cohesive aesthetics that allow individual expression while belonging to a tribe.The scarf is 190x30cm / 75x12inch and made of sustainable Merino wool in dark and lighter grey. Production and shipping costs are included in the token price. Minting of Spellbound tokens closes on the 1st of March, and redemption of your scarf is open until the 14th of March. Scarfs can only be redeemed once.Minting InstructionsThere are only two parameters to control here: a voice note and picking your scarf's design.Recording your voice note is done at the top of the token; these buttons will disappear after minting. The maximum length of your recording is 15 seconds, but you can stop recording beforehand. Once recorded, a scarf design will be generated. Some aspects of the design are relinquished to the gods of randomness. Therefore, you can pick from 5 different designs using the 'scarf design' parameter.You can't change the last four parameters; this is where the data of your voice note goes. If you randomize your parameters, random noise is the input. It is not recommended. Your wallet address is the seed for the random number generator; the design you see on the screen is what you get.Press ‘b’ to see the back of your scarf.Have fun!"

Metakinetic,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/metakinetic,working,"The concept behind ""Metakinetic"" is based on the idea of movement and metamorphosis. Each piece is created to be subsequently interpreted and traced by a plotter machine, reinforcing the evolving nature of the work. The choice of name reflects this intention: ""meta"" refers to the abstract representation of an articulated arm, which is then physically drawn by an actual articulated arm—the plotter. ""Kinetic"" refers to the element of movement inherent in both the artwork's theme and its method of production.This project also marks an important stage in my practice of plotter drawing. I made a conscious decision to develop works that could be plotted, ensuring that each creation could be adapted to different paper formats, from A4 to A1. The challenge was to ensure that proportions remained constant, regardless of the drawing's size, while using the same plotter tool.In other words, ""Metakinetic"" is an artistic exploration where form, function, and technical feasibility meet. The resulting pieces are both an expression of my personal aesthetic and a demonstration of the possible synergy between human creativity and mechanical precision.Plotter drawings are made with acrylic markers. This choice of material enriches the texture and depth of the works, highlighting the blend between traditional craftsmanship and modern technology.——————————————————————————————Press [s] in live mode to export an SVG file.Press [p] in live mode to export a PNG file.By specifying a 'format' parameter in the live URL, users can generate images in sizes ranging from A4 to A1, with A4 set as the default."

Realm Origins,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/realm-origins,working,"Welcome to the world of ""Realm Origins"" NFT card collection, imagine a realm where ancient beings and mythical warriors unite in a grand hierarchy, each card representing a unique character or artifact from this otherworldly universe.As you mint these collection cards, you embark on a journey to build your own personal army collection, with each card showcasing a unique identity. Your collection is a treasure trove of wonders waiting to be explored.*** IMPORTANT ***It is not just a SINGLE CARD, but rather a COLLECTION OF CARDS. You can check the collection size on the back view of the card. The collection can have a min of 9 cards and a max of 40841 cards in total. You can render or download each card from your collection.Each card has its own identity; you can consider it a personal card as well. A person has a name, title, rank, scores, gender, description, power, and a superior. I have also added a QR code.There is a rank system in place. The rank ranges from A to E, where A represents a high-rank card and E represents a low-rank card. The collection has a hierarchy system, which means all E cards would be under D cards, D cards under C cards, C cards under B cards, and so on.Ex: if there are 2 B cards and 10 C cards, the first B card could have 3 C cards under it, while the other B card could have 7 C cards under it.There is also a level system in place. There are two types of levels: count level and power level. The count level ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 represents a low number of cards and 5 represents a high number of cards. Similarly, the power level ranges from 1 to 12, where 1 represents a low-power card collection and 12 represents a high-power card collection.Ex: if the card's count level is 5, then the card collection size would be high. Similarly, if the card's power level is 12, the card in the collection would have more power. You can check the count level and power level in the console log.To determine card ranks and hierarchy, you can check the console for information on Card Rank, Under Cards, and Superior Name/Title. For instance, if a card has a Rank of D and 12 Under Cards, it indicates that there are 12 cards ranked below it. By analyzing this data, you can deduce the position of the current card in relation to others. Furthermore, observing the Superior Name can help in accurately identifying which specific card the current one is positioned under. To select a particular card, you have to add the &select=1,0,0,0,0 parameter in the URL. Now, what does the value ""1,0,0,0,0,0"" mean? In simple terms, it represents the location of the first card. You can understand it like this: ""1,0,0,0,0"" corresponds to ""A,B,C,D,E"". In this example, we are selecting the root card where all rank values are 0, and only the A rank card has a value of 1. Since there can only be one root card, we must use the number 1 for the A position.Default A Rank Card Location: &select=1,0,0,0,0Ex 1: &select=1,3,2,6,12, Here we will select E Rank CardA (1)└── B (3)....└── C (2)........└── D (6)............└── E (12)In this hierarchy tree:A Rank (Card 1) is at the top as the superior rank.B Rank (Card 3) is directly under A.C Rank (Card 2) is under B Rank (Card 3).D Rank (Card 6) is under C Rank (Card 2).E Rank (Card 12) is under D Rank (Card 6), representing the lowest rank.At this point we are selecting lowest rank card.Ex 2: &select=1,3,1,4,0, Here we will select D Rank CardA (1)└── B (3)....└── C (1)........└── D (4)............└── E (0) - There is not 0 cardIn this hierarchy tree:A Rank (Card 1) is at the top as the superior rank.B Rank (Card 3) is directly under A.C Rank (Card 1) is under B Rank (Card 3).D Rank (Card 4) is under C Rank (Card 1).Note: For download guide and more info, please consider console log in the browser.Important Note: The higher the total power of the collection, the more powerful it will be. The total power of the collection and individual card power will always be less than 1.Created by ArtLifeCreated using P5JS and QRIOUS (QR Code)Feb 2024"

Until biodiversity rains,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/until-biodiversity-rains,working,"Audiovisual generative artwork. In the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.Some alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.Relationship between visuals and sounds:Biological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.Towards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.This artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)[ f ] -> fullscreen[ p ] -> pause / play Note: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback.

Appearance and Being,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/appearance-and-being,working,"In 2021, I enrolled in a course about Genius, Inspiration, and Madness across ancient, European, and American traditions. A central theme of the course was a recurrent exploration of the Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy described by Nietzsche in his seminal work ""The Birth of Tragedy"". Nietzsche contrasts the Apollonian (order, structure, rationality) with the Dionysian (chaos, emotion, primal nature) and suggests the interplay between these two drives is essential for creating profound art, reflecting the complexity of human nature. For me, this study extended beyond academic curiosity. It reshaped my perspective, elevating a concept I was superficially familiar with into a recurring theme I observed in my life or applied in my artistic pursuits.""Appearance and Being"" (Schein und Sein) aims to build upon the explorations of my previous works, ""Sol"" and ""Space & Ego,"" effectively serving as a third installment in an ongoing study. The series uses handpicked cellular automata rules at a close-up, through which I consciously navigate the space between strict structure and organic unpredictability. I start with a rudimentary, perfectly square form distorting it to the point of obtuseness. The ironically sharp edges of these obtuse elements, juxtaposed against a fading, concealed underlying structure, balance authenticity and aesthetics.All works are designed with plottability in mind, aiming to convey solids, stripes, and gradients through lines.Recommended pen tips for plotting are:Solid iterations: 0.4mm (size 04), but also works across a range of pens.Striped iterations: 0.4mm (size 04), but also works across a range of pens.Gradient iterations: 0.2mm (size 005), also works with smaller sizes. One rare color palette combination was inspired by a wonderful book I discovered at my local library - Edith Young's ""Color Scheme."" The book offers many different palettes across a diverse set of subjects. From these, I selected and merged two favorites to create a two-color palette - The Pupils of the eyes in Vermeer's portraits (1656-72) and The reds of the red caps in Renaissance portraits (1460-1535).  Implemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.Press p to save a PNG of the image in full screen.

I found myself in a new world that had always been there but remained invisible.This artwork has a fractal structure: large dots do not actually exist; the illusion arises from the superimposition of the same pattern of interconnected smaller dots layered on top of each other. However, these smaller dots are also illusory: a mere dance of colors of the pixels of a monitor or pigments on a canvas.

While in the original game, the aim for the player is to connect a series of randomly generated pipe pieces to ensure the flow of 'goo' for a specified distance, in 'Pipes', unique left-to right-pathways are generated section by section.By refiguring this game and its components into a generative collection, 'Pipes' forms a part of an overarching series, 'The Art of Play', which seeks to highlight the aesthetic beauty of early gaming software."

Traces,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/traces-8,working,"Press [a] for full screen endless animation modePress [p] for print mode (default)(more instructions after description)-----Nature eschews right angles and simple, geometric shapes. Instead, everything we see in nature is shaped by processes where matter in different forms collides, exchanges energy, accumulates or disintegrates. Perpetual repetition of these natural processes weaves the beautiful complexity that surrounds us.Traditionally computers are seen as tools for working with ideal forms and exact mathematical representations, clean shapes and sharp angles. Even a random number generator running on a computer is a just a cheap trick to hide the underlying determinism.However, computers are also masters in repetition. They will blindly repeat a set of instructions for as many times as we want. And the repetition, shaping the initial state over and over again, creates the type of complexity we admire in nature.In this project, I have created a process, which repeats blindly by its own rules and adds layers and layers of marks on the canvas each new trace mixing with the existing ones. And the complexity in details that arises from the repetition starts to remind us about nature.-----Controls:- [a]: for full screen adaptive endless animation mode- [p]: for print mode (default, creates a printable image and stops)- [s]: Save PNG- [1] thru [6]: in print mode, change resolution multiplier (longer edge = 2000px times multiplier)With resolution multipliers 3 and up the preview animation is not drawn.Largest resolutions currently only work with Safari on a Mac and may take a very long time to generate.------ Requires WebGL2- Intended to be viewed on a Display-P3 compatible device and browser-----License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0Utilizes spectral.js library by Ronald van Wijnen (https://github.com/rvanwijnen/spectral.js) licensed under the MIT License."

Doodlescapism,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/doodlescapism,working,"The idea of Doodlescapism was born from memories of being a kid in school, doodling strange things on the last pages of a maths notebook, sitting in the back of a classroom during a long, long, boring lesson. The mind, ever-restless, sought refuge in the margins of learning - a clandestine world where geometric oddities forming strange matter clusters came to life.Knowledge of the only basics of perspective rules and a few of the simplest geometric forms can’t stop the children’s creativity. Moreover, it encourages them to use and master it over and over again, transforming doodles into hyperbolically primitivistic worlds, where cubes and spheres become leading actors in endless stories.Palettes are simple and saturated, such as a box of pencils and pens. Layers of lines appear one by one, adding details to the previous drawing or changing its appearance completely, like a kid who decides to change the whole plot entirely in the middle of the story. The generative art medium acts as a true allegory of children’s endless creativity, making unique iterations one after another while there is a spot of ink in your pens.Made with love and p5js.The code of this artwork is dimension-agnostic.Controls in fullscreen:[1] - save PNG at the current resolution[2] - save PNG 8000  x  5332[3] - save PNG 12000 x  7998"

Spot the Moire´,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/spot-the-moire,working,"This artwork is a captivating interplay of precise algorithms and subtle randomness. Its foundation lies in a circle packing algorithm created by my collaborator, Chris Scussel. We begin by filling the canvas with two layers of these circles, generating intriguing interference patterns – the mesmerizing moiré you see here.Imagine peacock feathers with their mesmerizing eyes, translated into precise geometric forms. The artwork employs points from a large circle, meticulously mapped to corresponding points on a smaller one. Both circles have the same number of points, which are then connected by lines, creating captivating shapes. But there's a twist! A subtle phase shift between the circles disrupts the perfect alignment, resulting in the mesmerizing moiré patterns.Look closely, and you'll see an echo of a traditional plotter drawing technique - creating tones and values through meticulously placed lines. While black dominates, a splash of red appears randomly, 5% of the time, adding vibrancy and a counterpoint to the composition.And that's not all! A multitude of carefully chosen random variables ensure that every refresh of the artwork unveils a unique iteration, keeping you coming back for more. So, delve into this dance of lines and circles, and uncover the hidden order within the mesmerizing chaos.Enjoy!Please visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com"

TIME SPECTRUM ,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/time-spectrum,working,"NOW use OPEN to PLAY with this interactive art. Press spacebar and it will stop while you check out the control options. Refresh to PLAY more.This mesmerising and pleasing art is based on a 1984 generative work by Geoff Davis of Micro (computer) Arts Group. It builds an image with layers, almost like a traditional painter applying paint to a canvas, which is then processed. The animation has speed control, including pause, and color controls which can be applied as the work is being created, and after it has been minted. This means one NFT defining the color and shapes, can create a huge range of art images. Even dark spooky images appear from the cheery hues of the innocent. Videos of this are on the microartsgroup website, or OPEN then PLAY here.Variations will show art of 7 different spectra and 1 full colour. The colors overlay in patterns so there are few pure hues. Color is a human psychological effect.The pale hues at the beginning are a colour field to rest your eyes, to “cleanse the palate”, before mellow soothing shapes appear. Yellow, often linked to the brightness of sunshine and the beauty of flowers, carries these positive associations even when in its pastel form. In the realm of color psychology, yellow is believed to be an invigorating hue that fosters a sense of optimism.Stare at the art and use a slow pace to relax. Have a rest from the rush and chaos.Controls OPEN the image to test these. Press 1 immediately and it slows down. Default speed is 4 fps.SPEED CONTROLSThis works before and mint, so you can experiment now.Spacebar	stop draw/restart toggle.Keypress1	very slow 1frame per second2	slow 2fps3	steady 4 fps4 	speedy 6 fps5	racing 8 fps6	very fast 16	7	top speed 48COLOR CONTROLS (works on draw process)8	Invert (makes dark)9	Grayscale0	Black and whiteColor controls work on the ongoing draw process, so you can mix up Inverted and Gray draws.

ConceptTIME is the animation control over speed and pause (time never goes backwards) and  SPECTRUM as rainbow colours are used.Interactive art as it is the colours that are changed, rather than interaction as gaming or finger twitching fidget spinning. Geoff Davis was involved with the London Film-Makers Co-op and London Video Arts before he started making generative art and text in 1984. He is an AI researcher, mainly in text, and is editor of the AI Creative Writing Anthology which has a second edition out in February 2024.The images can also be inverted (reverse colour) at any point in the art build process, which is shown in the animation (online soon).Expanded Art Berlin gave an exhibition of his work in December 2023, sponsored by fxhash as part of the 2.0 launch. This included abstract work from his teenage years as well as the 1980s and modern work."
Drei,https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/drei,working,"For Lia Drei (https://www.archivioguerrieridrei.com/biografia-1?lang=en)This morning I thought about all the work I did with triangles... the idea came to me that the right triangle is the symbol of creation...(…)The hypotenuse is the love that unites and gives life. The tip of the triangle is the uterus which makes the space grow.-- LIA DREI (Diaries, 2004)My paintings have no past, they are empty of meaning in the present, but await the discussions of the future, as remotely as possible.And this is why they don't have their feet firmly planted in the ground, although there are invisible roots that take life from the earth, like so many blades of grass.While I work I look for the truth in what I do. The time is not yesterday because it would be false, it is not today because the emotion takes my breath away and I die every moment and am reborn after every new brushstroke.Soon after, time becomes old, useless, meaningless. I never know what will come out with the next brushstroke or spatula stroke.My thoughts go at supersonic speed and only stop to choose another color. The one just painted is never the right one. So I live the life of the new painting with the sense of mystery that the moonless night has. (…)-- LIA DREI (Notes, 1962)----I never talk about myself.I'm not creative.I blatantly steal other people's art.I'm a bad coder, I copy, paste, mix ideas.I often ruin it, degrade it.But I always make it mine what I like.I absorb.-- ALESSANDRO FIORE (fxhash, 2024)—————The work is created responsive by default and it will adapt to the browser window.
